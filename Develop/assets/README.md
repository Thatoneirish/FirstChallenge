# Code Refactor Starter Code
My thought process going into this was that I should start small- I would go and check the links, and make sure everything worked first. The online reputation and social media marketing worked perfectly but for some reason the SEO link would only change the url and not move me. 

After a long session of staring at the screen and pondering this, I realized the Search engine opitmization in the "Content" section was using a 'class id' instead of a 'div id' and changing this seemed to fix the issue at hand. 

Afterwards I realized the code was a chore to look at, so i used comments to separate the code into blocks of more managable sizes to make it easier to look at. 

Then, looking through the css I found 4 different cases of lines of code that could be compressed to save space and make it easier to digest, fixing this, I'd call it a day.
